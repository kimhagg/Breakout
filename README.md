# Breakout

This is a repository for breakout assets in main with forks of the code for specific projects made by one person or small groups of people.

## Usage

 - Main will be used to store all the Graphics and Sounds.
 - Individual or group projects will have their own forks and projects specific to those forks.
 - Kanban use for assets will fall into categories of Ideas, Todo, In progress, Review and Done.
    - Ideas: Ideas for new assets to be created for the game.
    - Todo: Assets that passed the idea stage by people voting on them will end up in Todo
    - In Progress: Add your name to an Todo item and move it to In Progress to show that it has been started and who is working on it.
    - Review: After finishing the asset, push the asset and put the item in the review section.
    - Done: After checking that a pushed asset fits the theme of all the other assets, Approve of the push and add your name to the reviewed item on the Kanban, then move it to done. Each done part in the Kanban should have two names for assets.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. To push to main needs the approval of at least one other person involved with the project and may change in the future if more people join to make games with these assets.

Code should be in their individual forked projects. This will be a repo with multiple independent forks that all are based on the assets in main. Please see naming scheme below.

Single person project: name_dev  
Example: gatreh_dev

Group project: groupName_fork  
Example with the group name bees:
 - bees_prod
 - bees_dev  

Group project should have at least 2 forks. prod and dev with dev being forked further for features being developed.
